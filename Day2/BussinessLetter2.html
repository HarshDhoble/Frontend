    Subject: Request for Permission to Attend the Devsnest Workshop<br>

    <b>Respected Sir,</b><br>

    With due respect, my name is Harsh Dhoble, a student from Department of Computer Technology, having roll number 148.<br>

    I am writing this letter to request permission for attending a workshop organized by Devsnest.<br>

    Devsnest is a non-profit organization that aims to create highly skilled individuals by bridging the skill gap between colleges' academic curriculum and industry requirements and kick start their careers with good tech industry jobs.

Mentors for this initiative are from top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft.<br>

    This internship being a really important and integral part of my learning procedures, I request you to consider my situation and grant me permission for the same.<br>

    Look forward to your kind consideration.<br><br>

    <b>Yours Sincerely,<br>
